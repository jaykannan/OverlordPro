# Overlord Pro Cura Configurations
This repository is for cura and slic3r print profiles and settings for different types of filament for use with the [Overlord Pro](http://www.dreammaker.cc/store/index.php?route=product/product&path=59&product_id=51) by [Dreammaker](http://www.dreammaker.cc/)

All profiles are developments and should be tested before being used.
